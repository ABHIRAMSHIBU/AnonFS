### Connecting to Peer

Connection to peer is done via TCP. A single socket connection is made by a peer to another peer. All peers with public IP address will be having a TCPServer at port 9090. When a peer for example lets call it B connects to another peer with public IP address lets say A, then there will exist 3 phases Figure 1

1. Peer A by default is listening on port 9090

2. Peer B does a connect primitive to connect to Peer A

3. Peer A does an accept primitive to accept the connection from Peer B

Now Peer A has a new random port apart from 9090 connected to Peer B and Peer B uses the socket it connected with to Peer A.

This can be visualized as Figure 3 in implementation. Here TCP Server class is what gets the request of connection from Peer B and does the accept primitive to accept the connection there by creating a new random port on Peer A and sending the socket object associated with the new port to TCP Hander. Connection initiation is always done by the TCP Hander itself so it itself creates the socket object in the Peer B. Both transfers all the details to Core class as it's the glue that keep together all the classes and co-ordinates the actions.

When peers are connected together with a max simultaneous connection limit set to 2, Figure 2 can be taken as an example of such a mesh network. We have limited the number of connections so peers connect to 2 of the peers that they feel are closer to them.

### Uploading File to AnonFS

When a file needs to be uploaded into AnonFS, it needs to be divided into pieces. Piece size is decided by the configuration. If the piece size is smaller then it will result in the file being more distributed, but this also means that there is a chance for reduced speeds overall. So its necessary to keep a balance between distribution and speed. More number of piece will also mean that there will be more data lost just for keeping the header of each piece. Conversion of a file to piece and the Assembly information (Figure 9) is given in Figure 4. Structure of how a piece looks is given in Figure 5. Will_To_Live is basically how long after last access, piece should be alive.

When a piece is uploaded into a peer, there is a parameter that is to be specified with it, that is the TTL. TTL like in network is basically the time for the request to exist in the network. This can be used for distributing using peers to other peers or even used for preventing request flooding problem. In Figure 6, Peer 1 sends Piece 1 and Piece 2 to both Peer 2 and Peer 3 with a TTL of 1. This is why they relay the Piece to another neighbor which is not the originator of the request. 

### Downloading File from AnonFS

Downloading file is basically the above steps in reverse, now we will ask the nodes which we send the data to return the data. This message can also have a TTL which can be used to mirror the data to other nodes if necessary also to limit the propagation of request to under the TTL value. In Figure 7 Piece 1 gets a timeout when requested from Peer 2 this may be because Peer 2 was slow or was offline.

Figure 8 shows how the pieces is getting assembled to the original file. When it is assembled, checksum and signature are verified, if found faulty, its requested from another peer, and once it gets the valid piece it will notify other peer with correct information. For the original file to be revived, the peer must have its assembly information which is not kept in AnonFS and is supposed to be carried by the person who owns the file.
